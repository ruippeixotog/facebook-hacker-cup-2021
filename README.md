# Facebook Hacker Cup 2021

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from [Facebook Hacker Cup 2021][1]. These solutions are provided "as is" - I give no guarantees that they will work as expected.

## Instructions

You can compile all the problems by issuing the following command:

    $ make

If you want to compile only a specific problem, issue the following command, replacing `<problem_id>` with the section and identifier of the problem you want to compile (see section "Problems Solved" for the list of possible identifiers):

    $ make <problem_id>

Running a compiled problem is just a matter of executing a command similar to the next one, replacing `<problem_id>` with the identifier of the desired problem:

    $ ./<problem_id>

Unless stated otherwise, every problem in this repository reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.

## Problems Solved

The following is the list of the problems solved. Each problem identifier is specified between round brackets. Problems marked with ✓ are done, while problems with ✗ are not complete or aren't efficient enough for the problem's limits.

### Round 1

* ✓ [A1: Weak Typing (Chapter 1)][round1A1] (`weak-typing-1`)
* ✓ [A2: Weak Typing (Chapter 2)][round1A2] (`weak-typing-2`)
* ✓ [A3: Weak Typing (Chapter 3)][round1A3] (`weak-typing-3`)
* ✓ [B: Traffic Control][round1B] (`traffic-control`)
